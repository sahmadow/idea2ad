Ok this is good but the end user only need to see the following when generating campaign from URL:
1. Strategy Analusis (rename to Summary) + Brand Style + Audience Targeting side by side as it is now
2. Ad 1 (which is Google Imagen generated image (based on creative prompt), 
Primary text, Headline and Description - as per Meta guidelines
3. Ad 2 (which is the second Google Imagen generated image (based on another creative prompt), 
Primary text, Headline and Description - as per Meta guidelines
*These images should be presented as they will be seen in Meta. Example: /Users/salehahmadov/Documents/ClineProjects/idea2ad/example meta ad.png
4. User can select one of 2 options and click Launch My Campaign
5. Then the new page loads, where user needs to fill remaining information, which includes signing in with Facebook and authorizing access to facebook page so that we can run the campaign on their behalf, setting up the max budget,(duration is 3 days by default and Call to action by default is 'Learn More'). By the end of fillig this form user clicks Publish now -> which then allow us to publish approved campaign.

I want you to make sure that this scenario works end to end. If something is missing please ask questions and prompt for missing piece of information. You shouls take complete ownership of these tasks until the whole scenario works as expected. Run test after each step to make sure it works.
Run end to end test using browser once done
